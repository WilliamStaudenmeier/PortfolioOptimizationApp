# Portfolio_Optimization_App

Financial portfolio optimization can be an expensive, time-consuming process, so this weekend I built a free, automated application with a live feed to Yahoo #finance.

We normally think of portfolio optimization as it relates to the #stockmarket environment, but you can actually use similar models to optimize portfolios of assets other than stocks. At graduate school, for example, my friends and I built a portfolio optimization model for a major studio's movie offerings. I have also used portfolio optimization for space allocation on #ecommerce storefronts.

From an #rprogramming perspective, you can use the #quantmod package to pull real-time stock market data from Yahoo finance, the #ghyp package to run the optimization model, and #rshiny to create the interactive dashboard.
